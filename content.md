##SPECS
Specs codify the expected behavior. They are developed by Working Groups (WG) along with active discussion on mailing lists.

While we can’t always be 100% certain that all browser vendors will adhere to the rules set forth in a spec, they provide us with something that we, as developers, can standardize against.

######Resources:
* Take an [inside look at how the CSS WG works](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/) 
* Read through the [HTML5 Spec for developers](http://developers.whatwg.org/) with all implementor stuff removed, formatted beautifully for you.
* http://diveintohtml5.info/past.html history of HTML

######Mailing lists:
Subscribe to these to follow and contribute to the discussions that drive the web. (You'll also want to set up email filters so your inbox doesn't get smashed :)

######How to ask for help:
1. You'll probably want to [make a jsfiddle first](http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/)
2. [Create a reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/)

######Do what is asked in 'ask for help' above.


##WRITE
Publish what you learn and **don't be afraid to make mistakes**. Publish to your personal blog. Keep your posts updated. Speak with your own voice. It is okay to not be an absolute authority on a subject to author a post—ask questions and prompt conversations. There is seldom a wrong question or a wrong answer.

Teaching is a great learning tool as well. So, even if you are getting started in an area, you’re helping yourself by writing about it as well. You can always consider asking a mentor or friend for a technical review. (Addy's done that with aplomb)

######What should you start to learn about? Something you can teach others! Here are some ideas:
* why does `<br>` and `<hr>` or any element exist?
* how to create a slideshow with least code?
* what is your naming procedure for classes/ids?
* what is the DOM? why does it exist?
* Check how browsers implement a specific property and compare it to the spec. 
* Write on how a popular website implements their homepage (with suggestions for improvement)
* Take a popular demo and make it something else (or use it practically).
* Make a summary of popular ideas around the web lately
* Write about your experience contributing to an open source project.
* If you are a native speaker of a language other than English:
    * Translate some popular English web dev posts.
    * Elaborate on some of the features in the specs.

##MEETUPS
Attend your local meetups and conferences. Get together with other developers IRL to share your passion, and bring new ideas or collaborations to life.

Many post about their events on:

* [lanyrd.com](lanyrd.com)
* [meetup.com](meetup.com)


##FILE
######Submit bug reports to browsers. 
Seriously, **all** browser vendors would much rather you file tickets with them than tweet about bugs. :)

* Lea Verou's post on writing good bug reports (http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/07/help-the-community-report-browser-bugs/)
* John Resig's Responsibility post (http://ejohn.org/blog/a-web-developers-responsibility/)

##HACK
* Test cases are fundamental to standards and to browsers. 
* The W3C test suite for HTML would love help  http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/Testing 
* Look into [upstreaming some existing tests](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/Testing#New_tests) into the W3C Test suite
* Upstream WebKit's layouttests and Mozilla's mochitests to w3c suites
* http://www.webkit.org/blog/1456/layout-tests-practice/ and related posts.
* http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/LayoutTests 

##Contribute to browsers
* Help build devtools like webkit inspector ( http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebInspector ) , dragonfly ( https://bitbucket.org/scope/dragonfly-stp-1/ ) .
* They are written in HTML, CSS, and JS so you don't need to be a C++ programmer to contribute to these.
* Write patches!
* Reduce test cases for Mozilla: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_BugAThon

######Hack on WebKit, Gecko
* List of "good first bugs" for Firefox/Gecko http://bit.ly/ubtxSq
* join #introduction and #developers on mozilla IRC
* Google's guide on how to contribute to Webkit http://dev.chromium.org/developers/contributing-to-webkit

######Contribute to specs
* tests (see above)
* review ([file bugs](http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi), send email to WHATWG / public-webapps / www-style / fx)
* write http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/How_to_write_a_spec
* contribute to validators
